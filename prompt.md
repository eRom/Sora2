A neon-green and black cityscape glistens under a gentle digital rain. In the center of a quiet plaza lined with tall code pillars, a lone figure kneels in a flowing coat. Soft light from cascading symbols highlights the shape of their glasses and beard.

Cinematography: wide establishing shot, then a smooth slow zoom focusing on the figure as they rise from one knee to standing.

Mood: calm, introspective, and futuristic.

Actions:

The figure places a hand on the wet surface, triggering a ripple of flowing code.

A soft glow pulses across their glasses in time with a steady breath.

They press both hands to the ground, then push upward in a controlled, deliberate motion.

When fully upright, the code pillars shimmer in response.

Dialogue (echo-filtered): Hero (whispers): "Je me rel√®ve !" (spoken by a strong French male voice)

Background sound: low electronic hum, delicate digital chimes, and distant atmospheric tones.
